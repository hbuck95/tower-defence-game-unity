Dead Tree and Branch Modular Pack:

All assets created by Barbara Parkman, for use in Unity3D engine.

There are 12 modular pieces (stump, trunk and 10 branches) which can be put together in any combination up to and including a whole tree.  

Each piece has 4 skins (regular bark, shag bark, regular phosphorescent bark and shag phosphorescent bark).  

There are a multitude of possible configurations and 108 prefabs have been provided, 27 for each of the 4 skins:
blasted stump, hanging tree, individual pieces, miscellaneous deadfall, shattered tree, uprooted tree and whole tree.
A noose for the hanging tree is also included (LOD0 1288 tris, LOD1 296 tris). 

For use, just drag the prefab you want into your scene, or make your own configuration starting with any of the prefabs.
